Our version structure will be as follows:

X.0 - Major release usually with new features and major bug fixes, including emergency patches.
X.0.X - Emergency releases or major bug fixes.
X.X - Minor release usually with new features and minor bug fixes.


Beta builds will be released approximately 5 to 7 days before Stable builds, with the exception of emergency builds, which will be released simultaneously. If you are running the beta version, it's advised to switch back to the stable version for emergency builds. Once the next beta build is released, it's safe to use the beta builds again.
